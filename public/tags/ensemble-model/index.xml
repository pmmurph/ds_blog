      <description>Application Link (external)PurposeThis application takes in a .txt file with two columns delimited by a ‘|’. ex: ‘date’|‘value’ or more specifically yyyy-mm-dd|value. This was created for use in a live project, so thats the reason why these input restrictions exist. It also has the distinction of being my first Shiny app and as such I am inclined to leave it in it’s raw state. I probably wont make many changes to it, however i will consider making a better one from scratch in the future.</description>
