      <description>Application Link (external)PurposeThis application takes in a .csv file of observational or experimental data with headers. This was a school project written in a class teaching logistic models, however it creates Gaussian regression models as well.
What does it do?The user can simply hit ‘Sample Data’ if they do not have a csv handy. This data is from Hosmer and Lemeshow’s birth weight experiment and is a nice example real world example for getting into glms.</description>
